    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
    <p>
        My name is Spencer Quiner. I am a 44 year old American living in the Canary Islands, Spain with my wife Dácil, and my daughter Famara.
    </p>
    <p>
        My wife is spanish. I moved here with her just after we were married. Dácil and I were married in the Portland Oregon temple and have been 
        married for 11 years.
    </p>
    <p>Before starting to take classes through BYU Pathway  I worked as a web-developer but didn't have any formal schooling
        and some pretty large gaps in my knowledge. I am working towards a bachelors degree in Applied Technology in hopes of 
        expanding my skill base and filling in those knowledge gaps.
    </p>
    <p>I love reading and playing games. My preferred book genre's are science fiction and fantasy. I like playing video games, boardgames, and card games.
        My wife and daughter usually beat me at boardgames and card games but I still enjoy playing with them.
    </p>
    <p>
        I currently work remotely for an American Company. I happy with my current job but I want to develope the skills I need to not have worry 
        about whether I will be able to find a new job if the one I have now goes away. 
    </p>

        I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints all my life. My Parents were converts to the church. I was named after 
        President Spencer W. Kimball. There is a talk by Jeffery R Holland that was shared with me while I was on my mission that has had a great impact on me.
        But it is nearly impossible to find in the church library so I can't provide a reference to it. The part that stood out to me the most. Elder Holland
        explains that all of us have to spend some time with the savior in Gethsemane. He said that we can't expect life to be easy for us when it was never
         easy for the savior. Our discipleship has a price. 
         My favorite scripture is Doctrine and Covenants 101:16 "Therefore, let your hearts be comforted concerning Zion; for all flesh is in mine hands; be still and bknow that I am God."
