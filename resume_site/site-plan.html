        Introduction:
        I have always struggled writing resumes. The purpose of writing a resume is to try and convince someone that they should give you a job by showing them how your experience and education qualify you for the position, but you are only allowed one page of space. How do you fit a lifetime of experience and education in one page of space? The answer is you don’t. It’s impossible. So you end up trying to read the mind of the potential employer and include only the things that they will want to see.
